This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook and empty dependency arrays. The `bug.js` file contains a component with an `useEffect` hook that has an empty dependency array. This leads to unexpected behavior if the component's rendering depends on external data.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct way to use the `useEffect` hook to handle asynchronous operations and data fetching based on prop changes, preventing issues with stale data.
